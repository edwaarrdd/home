## What does it do?

This interactive application allows you to automatically interpret blood gases using the Fencl Stewart Approach with a graph that helps with visualisation of the steps.

## How to use it?

The Fencl Stewart Approach uses the sodium, potassium, chloride, base excess, lactate and albumin to calculate the different acid-base processes occurring. Input this data, and the program will output the interpretation using both the summative approach and visualisation approach. To learn more about the Fencl Stewart Approach, you can read more about it in [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14665553/).

## Why did I make it?

Whilst there are many applications online that will interpret a blood gas using the traditional approach, this is the first application that uses the Fencl Stewart Approach.

This can be used for interpreting blood gases, or as an aid for learning how to use the Fencl Stewart approach through the graphical representation.
