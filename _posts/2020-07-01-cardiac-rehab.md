## What does it do?

Automatically find the closest cardiac rehab centre (in Victoria) to a patient’s address.

## How to use it?

Type in the address of the patient, and the application will show the nearest cardiac rehab centre (and distance), as well as the next closest ones in order of proximity.

## Why did I make this?

During my cardiology rotation, when discharged patients would require Cardiac Rehab, we would have to find the closest centre to a patient’s address by looking at a physical map (with pins marking the location of the rehab centres). I wrote this application to automatically perform this process, so that it can be performed anywhere and anytime, as well as speed up the process of finding the nearest centre.
